        <p>
          I have devoted myself to the practice of meditation for the past 47
          years, and whenever I attain a meditative state, I feel as though I
          have tapped into an infinite source of energy and creativity. As a
          part of my daily routine, I make it a point to meditate every morning
          upon waking up from sleep.

        <h2>Cooking</h2>

        <p>
          I derive great pleasure from cooking, primarily because of the easy
          accessibility of recipes over the internet, and the assurance of
          knowing exactly what I will be consuming. I firmly believe that it is
          crucial to be aware of the components that make up one's diet, as they
          significantly impact both the mind and body.

        <h2>Ukiyoe Art Collection</h2>
        <img src="img/ukiyoe.png" width="360" height="240" alt="Ukiyoe" />
        <p>
          I have a collection of Ukiyoe prints that were created during the late
          Edo period, also known as the woodblock printing era in Japan's latter
          half of the 1800s. Although it is common to observe some color fading
          in the original prints, it is worth noting that all colors utilized in
          that era were sourced from natural ingredients, lending them an
          overall soft and gentle appearance. It was during this time that
          European artists began studying the Ukiyoe art style, and notable
          artists such as Vincent Van Gogh's painting style show great influence
          from Ukiyoe art.
